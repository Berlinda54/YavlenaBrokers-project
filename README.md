# YavlenaBrokers-project
- I used java as programming language in my framework.
- I used Selenium to automate the browser.
- I used maven as build automation tool which has pom.xml file that allows me to 
manage my project dependencies/versions.
- I used Page Object Model to simplify managing and maintaing my framework.
- I implemented BDD approach.I wrote my test case as scenario from the end users' perspective in Gherkin 
language in my feature file. I implemented the actual coding logic with JAVA-SELENIUM-JUNIT inside of my 
step_definitions package.
